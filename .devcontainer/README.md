# Dev Containers for Infrastructure Development
In order to minimize environment setup time, development environments have been prepared with pre-installed and configured tooling for this project.

## Pre-requisites
You will need to have Docker installed, and a way to run the dev container. We recommend using VS Code with the official [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.

## Getting Started
Once Docker and the Dev Containers extension have been installed, you should be able to access the command pallette in VS Code via CTRL+Shift+P. Use the command "Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container" to launch the container. With the extension installed, you may be prompted to launch the repository in the dev container upon opening the workspace in VS Code. The first build of the container may take a few minutes.
